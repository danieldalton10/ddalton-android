Experimental goalball statistics application.
This application is a proto type and demonstrates some of the main features for a goalball stat keeping app.

The app will need to be made more versitile for multiple teams, and more players.

Current features:
- Two teams HOME and AWAY each with 3 players
- For each of these players record goals, thros saves and errors 
- Generate a csv file and save to device with the following break down:
  Team,Player number,Saves,Errors,Goals,Throws,Throws per goal,Score times and goals vs errors
  Records these stats for all players and sums a total for each team
- Sharing of statistics 
- Smarts around errors and goals eg. hitting error for team AWAY gives a goal to the last thrower on team HOME.

TODO:
- 10 second and game timers 
- more statistics (very straight forward to add)
- Improve UI 
- More summary break down options currently only have game look to add player, season team weekly and other break downs
- Personalise teams and players. Allow to make and save teams and players who are named and can be tracked for all games they play in across multiple leagues.
- Autosaving current game state and resuming from some state (in case of crash or user error). Very easy - json dump
- Investigate other sharing options and formats.
- Consider using fragments in the UI
- Implement rules such as player must throw to score a goal
- Undo/delete function in case user hits wrong player / stat
- Way to view stats for the game during ap use.
